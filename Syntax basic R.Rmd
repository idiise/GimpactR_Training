## Important Keboard shorcut
to see all shortcut you can click to tools, keyboard shortcut help or directly click in console or in the script click **Alt + shift + k**.
  
Some useful shortcut that i usually use to organize my syntax:
  
  * To comment or uncomment **ctrl + shift +c**
  
  * To Run selected lines  **ctrl+ enter**
  
  * To create a section **ctrl+shift+R**
  
  * To Run a section **ctrl+alt+T**
  
  * Delete line **ctrl+D**

In R we have 4 basics functions important to create function Collect **c()**, repeat **rep()**, sequence1 **:**, sequence2 **seq()**
to create objects click to **Alt+6** or **Alt+ -**. For example in the code below we gonna create tree variables or Objects a, b and d
```{r}
a <- 6
b <- 10
d <- a+b
```
For numerical object you can directly click the value like in the code above but for String or character you need to put the element between **quote " "**.
Example below:
```{r}
names <- "Prince"
Country <-  "Ghana"
```
## Vectors
1. Collect and repeat
In R vectors can be consider as column in excel. For example if i want to create a column names like in excel with elements *Idrissa, Prince and Jacob* i can use the function collect *c()*
```{r}
names <- c("Idrissa", "prince", "Jacob")
age <- c(30,29,25)
Country <- c("Senegal", "Ghana", "Mali")
```
Each element of the code above can be consider as a column.
On the other hand how can i do if i want to **repeat** the names of **Prince 100 times** do i need to repeat prince 100 times in the collect c() function. Yes i can but it will take a lot of times so i can use the function **rep()** to do it quickly
```{r}
rep("Prince", 100)
rep(c("Idrissa","prince","Jacob"),c(3,2,4))
```
for more examples of rep you can click help(rep)
2. Sequences
If you have a dataset with 5000 lines and you want to create an ID of each row you can use the functions in the example below
```{r results= "hide"}
1:5000
seq(from = 1, to = 100, by = 5)
seq(from = -50, to = -20, by=5)
```
Please click help(seq) to see other examples with seq

## Exercices
* *Exercices 1*

Use the Picture below to:
1. Create 4 objects : Person, Sex, Weight, Height
2. calculate the mean for the variables if it is possible
3. calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) :BMI = weight/(Height/100)^2
4. create a dataset where you will have Person, Weight, Height, Sex and BMI

* *Exercice 2*
Create the following vectors

vec1 = 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5

vec2 = 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 5 5 5

vec3 = 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4
